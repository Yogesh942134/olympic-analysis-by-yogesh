A **Streamlit web application** and data analysis project that explores 120 years of Olympic data to uncover insights, trends, and statistics about nations, athletes, events, and medals.

📊 This is my **first data analysis project** where I use Python, Pandas and visualization libraries to build an interactive analysis dashboard.
